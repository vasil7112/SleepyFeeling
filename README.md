==========
Minecrafters have been fighting with Zombies, Skeletons and Spiders for a long time. Today, those players will be fighting a bigger threat, their fatigue! By forcing Minecrafters to go Sleep when they are tired we are adding a whole new level to Minecraft Realism. Fighting, Mining, or even Swimming will be harder, and players will have to manage their time efficiently so they can survive.
